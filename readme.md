Installation:
-------------
* Download the repository
* Remove the .gitignore and .gitattributes-files (they won't do any harm, but they're not needed)

If you want to add or remove allowed files, do that in the allowed_extensions-file - just add one for each line, or delete those you don't want
You can add any type of file
