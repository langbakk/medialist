<h2>Welcome to Uploadr</h2>
<div class="content">
	<p>Hi. You've found Uploadr. This is a file-storage/upload-whatever-you-want type of site, which enables you to <a href="register">create a user</a> and upload to your private account (and share publicly, if you want), or just go to <a href="upload">upload</a> and start uploading stuff. There are some limits as to what type of files you can upload, but most video, image and documents should work without having to adjust the config.</p>
